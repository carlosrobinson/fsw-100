        As you can tell, I'm a big SYFY fan. It's just something about this genre <br>that 
        sparks my inner imagination. The excitment of space, heroes, adventure, and <br>technology, shows that ideas are limiless. Although, there's <br> thin line between 
        fact and fiction, you can help but wonder what are the real possibilities. <br>In my opinon, we wouldn't have the ideas or technology we have without a little imagination.
